                  I have not seen as others saw<br>
                  I could not bring my passion from a common spring,<br>
                  From the same source i have not taken my sorrow<br>
                  I could not awaken my heart to joy at the same time,<br>
                  And all i loved, I loved alone.<br>
                  Then in my childhood--in the dawn of a most stormy life,<br>
                  Was drawn from every depth of good and ill,<br>
                  The mystery which binds me still<br>
                  from the torrent or the fountain,<br>
                  from the red cliff of the mountain,<br>
                  from the sun that round me rolledin its autumn tint of GOLD<br>
                  from the lightning in the sky as it passed me flying by,<br>
                  From the thunder in the storm and the cloud that took the form<br>
                  When the rest of the heaven was blue<br>
                  Of a demon in my view.<br>

                  <h3 class="plan__name">In the ancient days when the first quiver of speech 
                    came to my lips<br>
                    I ascended the holy mountain and spoke unto GOD, saying<br>
                    'Master, I am thy slave,<br>
                    thy hidden will is my law and i shall obey thee forever more',<br>
                    But GOD made no answer, and like a mighty tempest passed away.<br>
                    And after a thousand years i again ascended the holy mountain and 
                    spoke unto GOD saying,<br>
                    'Creator, i am thy creation, out of clay has thou fashioned me and 
                    to thee i owe my all',<br>
                    And GOD made no answer, but like a thousand swift wings passed away.<br>
                    And after a thousand years i climbed the holy moutain and spoke 
                    unto GOD again, saying,<br>
                    'Father i am thy son,<br>
                    In pity and love thou hast given me birth, and through 
                    love and worship i shall inherit they kingdom',<br>
                    And GOD made no answer, and like the mist that veils
                     the distant hills, he passed away.<br>
                    And after a thousand years I climbed the sacred mountain 
                    and again spoke unto GOD, saying,<br>
                    'My GOD my aim and my fulfillment, i am thy yesterday and
                     thou are my tomorrow,<br>
                    I am thy root in the earth and thou art my flower in the sky,<br>
                    and together we grow before the face of the sun.<br>
                    Then GOD leaned over me, and in my ear whispered words of sweetness,<br>
                    and even as the sea that enfoldeth a brook that runneth down to her,<br>
                    He enfolded me.<br>
                    And when i descended to the valley and the plains<br>
                    GOD was there also.<br>
